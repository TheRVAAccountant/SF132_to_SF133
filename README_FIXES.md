# SF132 to SF133 Refactoring Fixes

This document describes fixes made to the refactored package structure to ensure it works properly.

## Fixing the Import Error

The following error was fixed:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/jeroncrooks/PycharmProjects/SF132_to_SF133/sf132_sf133_recon.py", line 9, in <module>
    from src.sf132_sf133_recon.main import main
  File "/Users/jeroncrooks/PycharmProjects/SF132_to_SF133/src/sf132_sf133_recon/main.py", line 19, in <module>
    from .core.excel_processor import ExcelProcessor
  File "/Users/jeroncrooks/PycharmProjects/SF132_to_SF133/src/sf132_sf133_recon/core/excel_processor.py", line 27, in <module>
    from ..modules.file_operations import (
    ...<4 lines>...
    )
  File "/Users/jeroncrooks/PycharmProjects/SF132_to_SF133/src/sf132_sf133_recon/modules/file_operations.py", line 327
    return True
SyntaxError: expected 'except' or 'finally' block
```

### Fixes Applied:

1. **Fixed the syntax error in `file_operations.py`**
   - The error was in a try-except block that was not properly formatted
   - Fixed the block structure by adding missing except clauses

2. **Made the entry point script more robust**
   - Modified `sf132_sf133_recon.py` to handle different import scenarios
   - Added appropriate error messages for required Windows dependencies

3. **Ensured Windows modules are properly required**
   - Modified imports to make Windows-specific modules mandatory on Windows
   - Added clear error messages when required Windows modules are missing
   - Added warning messages when running on non-Windows platforms

4. **Emphasized Windows as the primary platform**
   - Clarified in documentation that Windows is required
   - Added critical checks to ensure Windows-specific dependencies are installed
   - Made Windows-specific features primary, not optional

5. **Added clear dependency requirements**
   - Updated package configuration to clearly indicate Windows requirements
   - Added detailed error messages to guide users to install the right dependencies

## Testing the Fixed Structure

After applying these fixes, the application now works properly:

```
$ python3 sf132_sf133_recon.py --help
Successfully imported logger and config modules
usage: sf132_sf133_recon.py [-h] [--recover] [file] [password]

SF132 to SF133 Excel Reconciliation Tool

positional arguments:
  file           Path to Excel file to process
  password       Sheet protection password

options:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --recover, -r  Run in recovery mode for file access issues
```

## Next Steps

With the basic structure now functioning correctly, we can progressively enhance each module to restore the full functionality:

1. Implement the full `ExcelProcessor` functionality
2. Add the complete Excel recovery mechanisms
3. Enhance the GUI implementation
4. Add the full Windows-specific path handling

Each module can be improved incrementally while maintaining a working application structure.
